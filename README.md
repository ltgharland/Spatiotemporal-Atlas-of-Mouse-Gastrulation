## A Spatiotemporal Atlas of Mouse Gastrulation and Early Organogenesis to Explore Axial Patterning and Project In Vitro Models onto In Vivo Space

This repository contains analysis scripts to process and analyse the single cell spatial transcriptomic profiling of mouse embryos across gastrulation and early organogenesis using the seqFISH platform.

The pipeline to project additional scRNA-seq datasets into the spatiotemporal atlas (such as the gastruloid dataset used in the manuscript) is found in the 5_bioinformatics_pipeline folder.

Data can be interactively explored at this link: http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/SpatiotemporalMouseAtlas/ 

Processed data can be downloaded using the links provided on the front page of the interactive exploration Shiny app above.

All analyses were performed in R (version 4.2.1).
